- **Blue platform mechanics** - every 4th platform gives super bounce
- **Smooth physics system** with gravity, jumping, and collision detection
- **Infinite platform generation** with random sizes and gaps
- **Screen wrapping** - ball can go off edges and appear on opposite side
- **Visual effects** including score animations and bonus displays
- **Responsive design** that works on different screen sizes
- **Game over screen** with final score display
- **Project documentation** with comprehensive README
- **Development tools** including package.json and .gitignore
